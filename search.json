Maternal plants subpopulations collected , transplanted greenhouse Wyoming, USA. first generation seeds transplants collected grown another round seed collection (generation two). grew invader-experienced invader-naïve seedlings generations growth chamber Illinois, USA. found largest shifts root traits invasive exposure status (e.g., root mass fraction (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.5), primary root count (SMD) = 0.52), root length (SMD) = 0.44)); invader-experienced plants significantly larger root traits generation two, associated greater survival, thus may adaptive.  Since invader-experienced accessions evaluated valuable restoration material invaded sites, findings highlight need continued root research multigenerational invasive plant interactions need evaluate one generation removed biotic influence.","code":""},{"path":"https://aliciafoxx.github.io/foxxlab/reference/fvk2024.html","id":"ref-examples","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Examples","title":"Foxx Disrupting Ecology Lab data package Dataset Description — fvk2024","text":"","code":"if (FALSE) {   head(fvk2024) }"},{"path":"https://aliciafoxx.github.io/foxxlab/reference/fw2021.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Dataset Description — fw2021","title":"Dataset Description — fw2021","text":"dataset contains information Bromus tectorum study.","code":""},{"path":"https://aliciafoxx.github.io/foxxlab/reference/fw2021.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Dataset Description — fw2021","text":"","code":"fw2021"},{"path":"https://aliciafoxx.github.io/foxxlab/reference/fw2021.html","id":"format","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Format","title":"Dataset Description — fw2021","text":"data frame 78 observations 12 variables: .
